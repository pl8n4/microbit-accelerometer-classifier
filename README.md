# microbit-accelerometer-classifier
group project for CI - data logging with microbit and classification

## Motivation

We wanted to see how basic movement data, like shaking or holding still, could be automatically recognized using machine learning. Since motion tracking plays a big role in neuroscience — like in rehab or brain-computer interfaces — we used a Micro:bit to collect accelerometer data and trained models to classify movement. It’s a simple demo of how wearable tech and data science can work together in neuro-focused applications.
